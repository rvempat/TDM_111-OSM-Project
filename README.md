# TDM_111-OSM-Project

# About the Project
The goal of this project is to add parking lot suggestions to Open Street Maps (OSM) using a machine learning model trained on
satellite images. We use data currently in OSM to train our model. We currently have the coordinates of 221 surface-level parking
lots in the Indianapolis region.
